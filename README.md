# AdventOfCode
A few of my code snippets for the competition on **Advent Of Code**
[http://adventofcode.com/]

I used this competition as a training camp to get hands dirty with **Python**.

In this repository you may find some of my solutions to the problems from Advent of Code.

To sum up, that was **valuable experience** and *amazing chance* to learn something new (*python, in my case*)!
